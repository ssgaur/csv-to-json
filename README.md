Converting a CSV File into a JSON file


Here is the email with the round 2 task that I've put together for you. I wish you all the best!


Write a script that takes an input CSV file and outputs a JSON file. The goal of the script is to parse and validate the data in the CSV file correctly and to output the resulting value in a JSON file that contains all the rows from the CSV file properly validated and type casted.

Assume that each cell in the CSV can be one of the following types that need to be typecasted and validated:
Integer
Decimal
String
Date
Time
Boolean
Null
A sample CSV input file is attached below for reference, which you can use for testing the script with.

Instructions
Make your changes and push your code regularly to this repo: https://github.com/Zephony/csv-importer so that we can look at it and give you any feedback whenever we can
Update the README file with instructions on what the script does and how to use it.
Use Python3 to write the script
Use the standard csv module in Python
For CSV validation, you are allowed to use the Python Voluptuous validation library
Evaluation
Readable code with proper documentation/comments
Edge-case coverage
Efficiency (should be faster for large files with 1000s of rows)
Descriptive commit messages
We'd like to expect the script by next Wednesday (Feb 26). I understand that it can be difficult to cover all cases, so cover as much as you can within the timeframe. Feel free to let me know, however, if you need more time or if you have any questions.

Kindly confirm and share your Github account details so that we can provide access to the repo. 

Best Regards.
